# Thales Module Structure

## Overview

The Thales toolkit is organized into several modules, each focused on specific functionality:

```
thales/
├── database/       # Database interaction and verification
├── generators/     # Test data generation
├── simulators/     # Service simulation
├── runners/        # Test scenario runners
├── diagnostics/    # Error collection and analysis
└── load/           # Load testing
```

## Modules

### database

- **inspector.py**: Provides tools for examining and comparing data across MongoDB, Neo4j, and Qdrant
- **consistency.py**: Verifies data consistency between different data stores

### generators

- **concept_generator.py**: Generates mock concept data and populates test databases
- **relationship_generator.py**: Helper for generating realistic relationships between concepts

### simulators

- **service_simulator.py**: Creates mock services with configurable behavior for testing

### runners

- **integration_runner.py**: Executes integration test scenarios defined in YAML configuration

### diagnostics

- **error_collector.py**: Collects and analyzes error patterns across services
- **error_analyzer.py**: Finds correlated errors and identifies common patterns

### load

- **load_tester.py**: Performs load testing against service endpoints

## Extension Points

The toolkit is designed to be extensible:

1. **New Inspectors**: Extend DatabaseInspector for new databases
2. **New Generators**: Create generators for different data types
3. **Custom Simulators**: Implement domain-specific service simulators
4. **Test Scenarios**: Define new test scenarios in YAML configuration

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to work independently or together
2. **Reusability**: Core functionality can be used by other services
3. **Testability**: All components follow TDD practices
4. **Configuration-driven**: Behavior is driven by configuration files
