  "script": "Lyceum will be implemented in four strategic phases: In Foundation Phase during months 1-3, we'll establish core infrastructure with Terraform, implement basic agent services on Kubernetes, establish the Kafka event backbone, create our foundational knowledge graph, and develop basic dialogue capabilities. This will deliver basic dialogue-based learning and guided knowledge exploration. In Intelligence & Integration Phase during months 4-9, we'll deploy Galileo's GNN for pattern analysis, implement knowledge extraction through Alexandria, develop content generation through Gutenberg, create assessment capabilities with Aristotle, and integrate agent interactions through our service mesh. This will enable fully personalized learning paths and adaptive content. In Advanced Features Phase during months 10-15, we'll implement character embodiment through Hypatia, develop the Learn & Earn system through Hermes, create AR/VR interfaces, enhance our GNN with more sophisticated learning models, and develop comprehensive monitoring. This will deliver the complete Lyceum experience with historical characters and immersive content. Finally, in Scale & Optimization Phase during months 16-24, we'll optimize for large-scale deployment, improve agent efficiency through learned patterns, expand our content library, develop additional agent specializations, and create partner integration APIs, resulting in a mature platform with broader content offerings and third-party integration capabilities.",
