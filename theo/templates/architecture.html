                <h3>Modular Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Each component is designed as a discrete service with clear boundaries and interfaces,
                    enabling independent scaling, development, and deployment of different system parts.

                <h3>Knowledge-First</h3>
                <p>
                    The knowledge graph is our central organizing principle, mapping relationships between
                    concepts, learning resources, and educational pathways.
                </p>

                <p>
                    User data protection and privacy controls are built into the core architecture,
                    not added as an afterthought. Data ownership remains with the learner.

                    The system continuously adapts to learner behavior and performance,
                    using machine learning to optimize learning pathways in real-time.

                <h3>Knowledge Graph Engine</h3>
                <p>
                    The knowledge graph is the heart of Lyceum, representing the interconnected nature of human knowledge.
                    It maps concepts, their relationships, prerequisites, and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our graph engine uses a combination of expert-created structures and machine learning to continuously 
                    evolve and refine these knowledge relationships based on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Educational research and subject matter expertise</li>
                    <li>Actual learning patterns and outcomes</li>
                    <li>New discoveries and content</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This graph provides the foundation for personalized learning paths and ensures that learners build 
                    knowledge in a structured, coherent way.

                <h3>Dialogue System</h3>
                <p>
                    Our dialogue system embodies the Socratic method, engaging learners in meaningful conversations
                    that help them discover and understand concepts through questioning and exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built on large language models and reinforcement learning, the system:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adapts to the learner's current understanding</li>
                    <li>Asks probing questions that encourage critical thinking</li>
                    <li>Provides explanations that connect to the learner's existing knowledge</li>
                    <li>Identifies and addresses misconceptions through gentle correction</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The dialogue system is designed to be a supportive guide rather than an authority,
                    encouraging learners to reach their own conclusions.

                <h3>Learning Path Engine</h3>
                <p>
                    The learning path engine creates personalized educational journeys for each learner,
                    combining insights from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The knowledge graph's concept relationships</li>
                    <li>The learner's current knowledge and gaps</li>
                    <li>Optimal learning sequence research</li>
                    <li>The learner's goals and preferences</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Using reinforcement learning algorithms, the system dynamically adjusts these paths based on learner 
                    performance, engagement, and feedback. The result is a constantly optimizing educational experience
                    that balances challenge with achievability.

                <h3>Content Generation System</h3>
                <p>
                    Our content generation system creates educational materials dynamically, tailored to each learner's needs.
                    The system can produce:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear explanations of complex concepts</li>
                    <li>Practice problems and assessments</li>
                    <li>Visual aids and diagrams</li>
                    <li>Summaries and reviews</li>
                    <li>Connections to real-world applications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Content is generated using a combination of template-based approaches and large language models,
                    with quality assurance processes to ensure accuracy and educational value.
